# Challenge-2

## Description 

This website showcases some of my previous projects. It's purpose is to do just that, mostly for myself. But, also for you! My goal is to continue to populate this with projects as I continue to learn and create. I think the main thing this project helped me to learn is the importance of keeping track of what you have done. This does just that, plus its fun to just click on pictures and see the inside-work of my projects.

## Usage
